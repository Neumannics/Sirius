# EMS (Event Management System)

### INTRODUCTION
In the current pandemic, organizations have turned to Whatsapp to manage these sorts of activities but the app isnâ€™t meant for this. All the important messages get buried under the spams and it is a headache to find the messages when required. The platform would be an alternative to using Whatsapp for administrative tasks and it will make management a breeze.

### DESCRIPTION
The project will consist of two parts: a frontend and a backend. The student will be able to interact with the frontend and keep a track of all the upcoming events and activities of the club that he is a part of along with the schedule of their classes. Users can create new teams and they can also create teams within a team to maintain a hierarchy. The admin can create roles and give custom permissions to each role. Later, those roles can be assigned to anyone who joins the team. Users can create new notices, events or classes if they have the permission.
